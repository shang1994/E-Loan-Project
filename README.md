# E-Loan-Project
This project is to compare the performance a few classification models in predicting the likelihood of a customer signing an E-Loan with the company. 
The main goal of the project is to study the following
1) Performance between parametric and non-parametric classification models
2) Using of cross-validation to check model results
3) The effect of hyper-parameter tuning of a chosen model on its performance
4) We want to acive a model with the highest precision score
